#Main goal of the project:

Make a web application that analyzes prices for goods on websites using a service written in Python using some kind of flask (there, in fact, you will need to write one crud and that’s it). The service will have to collect data from online stores and transfer it to the database.

Write a service in Java that will collect data from the database and retrieve it at the user’s request. Using Spring Security, you can make a division into admin and user, write an admin panel for the admin and write a user panel for the user

Implement caching of received data for the user using Radish and deploy all services in AWS

I will write the front on the ReactJS
